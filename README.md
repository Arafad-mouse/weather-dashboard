```markdown:CONTRIBUTING.md
# Contributing to Weather Dashboard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Weather Dashboard as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
We use GitHub Flow. So all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Arafad-mouse/weather-dashboard/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Arafad-mouse/weather-dashboard/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [arafat.mouse.omer@example.com]. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS for API calls
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Security Considerations

- This application uses client-side JavaScript to make API calls
- API keys are visible in the client-side code (consider using environment variables for production)
- User data is not stored or transmitted beyond weather API calls
- No personal information is collected or stored

## Reporting Security Issues

When reporting security issues, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure!
```
